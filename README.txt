Motivation

To understand what true Development means ? 

Create Awareness - Equal distribution of responsibility to protect our planet 

To analyse the correlation (if any) between economical prosperity with environmental sustainability. 

 

OVERALL QUESTION: Does a wealthier/more developed nation mean it is greener ?

Q1. Do developed countries recycle more than other developing countries ? Does GDP play a part ? 

Q2. Do developed countries have a  bigger carbon footprint ? 
	
Q3. Does a countryâ€™s GDP relate to its clean energy generation ?


We looked at development/GDP of countries vs their greeness. 
We found that Waste generation and recycling shows that higher income countries have
more waste generate and do recycle a larger amount of waste but that is just proportional 
to the large amount of waste they generate. The air pollution did not show any significant 
corrolation to the GDP.

The energy generation tends to be leaning more towards clean energy in "developed" countries
but it is not of of statistical significance.
